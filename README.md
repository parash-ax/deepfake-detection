# DeepFake Detection Using CNN

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a DeepFake detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal of the project is to accurately identify AI-manipulated videos using deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Implements a CNN-based model for DeepFake detection.
- Achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset of synthetic and authentic videos.
- Utilizes Python, TensorFlow, and Keras for model development and training.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parash-ax/deepfake-detection.git
   cd deepfake-detection
