The increasing computational capacity has made deep learning algorithms so powerful that generating an indistinguishable human produced movie, often known as deep fakes, has become very simple. Scenarios in which realistic face swapped deep fakes are used to cause political unrest, fake terrorism events, revenge graphic material, and blackmail people are easily imagined. In this paper, we provide a novel deep learning-based strategy for distinguishing AI-generated fake films from real ones. Our approach can automatically detect deep fakes that involve replacement and reenactment. We are attempting to combat Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our approach uses a Res-Next Convolution neural network to extract frame-level characteristics, which are then utilized to train the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used to determine whether a video has been manipulated or not, i.e., whether it is a deep fake or a true video. To simulate real-time events and improve the model's performance on real-time data, we tested our method on a huge quantity of balanced and mixed dataset created by combining multiple accessible datasets such as FaceForensic++ [1], Deepfake detection challenge [2], and Celeb-DF [3]. We also demonstrate how our system can generate competitive results through a relatively simple and adaptable technique.
